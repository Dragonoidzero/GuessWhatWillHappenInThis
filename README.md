# Guess What Will Happen In This

Fabric mod where anyone can PR anything, concerning or not. I'll merge everything as soon as it works. 

## How can I ~~fuck up~~ contribute to this project ?

You can do **ANYTHING**, adding blocks, items, whatever you want, mess with mixins, break vanilla mecanics, add dependencies, PR entire projects, as soon as it doesn't break other contributions.
